# 3D-Visualization

Maps come into action as soon as location is involved. However, to visualize changes and the dynamics in our multi-dimensional society requires solutions beyond the standalone ’traditional’ 2D map. Not only interaction is required to view multi-dimensional objects from different angles or to move along the timeline to see change in action, but also options to see alternatives and to reason.

Qgis2threejs QGIS plugging was used for this project.
